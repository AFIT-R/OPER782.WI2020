## This presentation covers the following concepts

- Getting started with Git and Github

- Why you should use Git & Github

- The basics of version control systems

- Using Git and Github for collaborative software development

# Getting Started with Git & Github

## What is Git?

- A tool invented by Linus Torvalds (and the Linux development community) to develop the Linux kernel in 2005

- A <u>distributed</u> version control system that's free and open source

- An excellent way to track and coordinate file changes among many people

- A system for filing every draft of every document in a project

- The most widely used modern version control system in the world -- <focus>by far</focus>

- Free software distributed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) version 2

- While mainly used for code, Git can be used to manage any type of file/project 
  
    + Word documents
    
    + Final Cut projects
    
    + The entire volume of [German federal laws](https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze)

## What is GitHub?

- A hosting service for sharing and publishing documents

- A social networking site for programmers

- The single largest web-based service for hosting Git repositories

- A popular way to collaborate on code (no more emails and zip files!!)

    + The development versions of many R packages are hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2
    
    + All the [cool kids](https://github.com/auburngrads) are using it!

- Includes several features beyond command-line Git

    + A Web-based graphical interface
    
    + Task/project management tools
    
    + A [martketplace](https://github.com/marketplace) of integrations for many 3^rd^ party services
    
    + [Issues!](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
    
    + [Forking!](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
    
    + [Projects!](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/)

# Why Should You use Git and GitHub?

## For a fast, easy, and stress-free workflow

<img src="images/before-version-control.png" style="float: right; padding: 100px 300px 0px 5px; width: 250px;">

<ul style="display:inherit;">
- Workflows without Git typically consist of

    * Lots of File renaming
    * Absurd folder structures
    * Zipped folders
    * E-mailing files back and forth
    * Lost files
    * Shared directories (one-at-a-time)
    * Ever try merging MS Word files with tracked changes?!

# OK, I'm interested in using Git/Github how do I get Started?

## Installing Git

- Installing Git is simple - on Mac/Windows/Linux/Unix

    1. Download Git from <https://git-scm.com/downloads>. 
    2. For Mac/Linux/Unix - Accept all installation defaults
    3. For Windows - accept all installation defaults __EXCEPT__ Choose Use Git Bash as the default editor

```{r, out.width = "800px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/win-git.png")
```

## Setting up a GitHub account

- First, navigate to [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

```{r, out.width = "800px", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/github.png")
```

- Enter some basic information about your new account

    + A pithy username (hopefully it's still available)
    + An email address (don't use your @afit.edu email)
    + A password
    + After completing this step you'll need to validate your email address by clicking the link embedded in the email sent to you

```{r, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/signup.png")
```

- Set up your profile

    + On your account homepage, go to the "Profile" tab and click "Upload new picture" to update your avatar or icon

    + Github maps commits to users via their email address; on the "Emails" tab, you can assign primary and alternate email addresses

    + Under the "Security" tab, you can set up Two Factor Authentication (2FA). You can configure either a time based one-time password using a phone app or a code sent to your cell phone via SMS

```{r, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/my-profile.png")
```

## Configure Git for first time

- After installing Git and setting up a Github account

    + You need modify the global Git configuration file to tell Git who you are
    + Open a terminal or Git Bash (Windows) and enter the following two lines: (with the obvious modifications) 
    
```{sh, eval=!TRUE, echo=T}
# Use Github username 
git config --global user.name Auburngrads

# Use Github email address
git config --global user.email auburngrads@live.com
```

- Since you passed the option `--global`, you only need to do this once!

## Now you're all set up to use Git & Github!

- <focus>However</focus> - before we dive too deep into Git, we need to take a step back 

    + Git is one of many different version control systems (VCS)

    + It's important to put Git in context 
    
    + You should understand what a VCS is, what types of VCS exist, and how they differ

# Understanding Version Control Systems

## What are version control systems?

## Why should some use a version control system?

## What is a Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)?

## What is a Decentralized (aka Distributed) Version Control System (DVCS)?

## What are the advantages of using a DVCS instead of a CVCS?

# Using Git - Overview

## Expectation management - this tutorial won't cover all use-cases

- New users often struggle learning how to use Git and conclude that it's too hard

- This struggle is driven by the fact that there seems to be an endless number of use cases

- The issue is NOT that Git is too <u>hard</u> to learn, rather Git is too <u>big</u> to learn

- The fact that Github adds it's own functions makes things even more complicated

- Remember <focus>Git $\ne$ Github</focus>

## Many Ways To Use Git

- At the **command line**

    + Simplest (really!) & fastest
    + Works the same on Windows, Mac, and Linux
    
- Within an IDE (e.g. RStudio)

    + Convenient when building R packages
    + Can be clunky to update many files
    
- From a Git [desktop GUI](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)

    + Works well for many files
    + Adding another application can interrupt the workflow

- Hybrid method with [libgit2](https://libgit2.github.com/)

    + Write custom scripts using the `git2r` package
    + Best option - but comes with a semi-steep learning curve

## The basic process of Git

- Initialize Git version tracking in a directory
- Add or edit files in the directory
- Check the status of file changes in the directory
- Add changed files to the staging area
- Commit one or changed files to be updated
- Add a remote for hosting the files at a URL
- Push commits to the remote
- Send pull requests to collaborate with other users
- Check out the [Git Flow interactive](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)


## The basic Git commands you'll use/need

- `cd` (change directories)
- `git init` (initialize a folder as a Git repo)
- `git add <file-name>` (start tracking a new file)
- `git commit -m "fix typo"` (commit your changes)
- `git clone` (clone/copy another Git repo [e.g., from GitHub])
- `git push origin master` (push your master branch to your origin server)
- `git pull origin master` (update your local repo)

# Using Git - Example commands

- Initialize a repo in an existing directory

    + Create a new folder called `arithmetic` anywhere on your computer (e.g., the Desktop) 
    + In this folder, create a new R script file called `add.R` 
    + In this new file add the following code
    
```{r, echo=TRUE}
add <- function(x, y) { x * y }
```

## Initializing a repo in an existing directory

- Next, open a terminal or Git Bash (Windows) and go to the project's root directory

- For example, the code below takes me to the folder called `arithmetic` on my Desktop

```{sh, echo=TRUE, eval=F}
cd C:/Users/Aubur/Desktop/arithmetic
```

- Then, to initialize this as a Git repo, just type

```{sh, echo=T, eval=F}
git init
```

- This add a new directory called `.git` within the `arithmetic` project directory

- If you want to start version-controlling all the files, you need to start tracking them. In the terminal, type the following:

```{sh, eval=F, echo=T}
git add --all
```

- This adds all of the files to the staging area 

- Then type the following to commit the file changes 

```{sh, eval=F, echo=T}
git commit -m "first commit"
```

## What's in the .git directory?

- The `.git` folder contains metadata about your project required to support version control using Git, this includes:

    + Information about each commit
    + The remote repository address
    + A log of your commit history so that you can roll back to a prior version

# Using Git - Syncing with GitHub

## Overview

- Often, you'll want to host a local Git repo on Github to use the collaboration tools

- To do this, we'll first need to create a new repo on Github

```{r, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/new-repo.png")
```

- The name of the Github repo doesn't have to be the same as that of the local repo, but it probably should 

```{r, out.width = "600px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/new-repo-2.png")
```

- Next, we'll add the URL of the Github repo as a `remote` to the local repo 

- The `remote` acts like an online target for pushed changes 

```{r, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/new-repo-3.png")
```

- Finally, we'll push the an image of the local repo's current state and the entire change history to the `remote` 

```{r, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/new-repo-4.png")
```

# Using Git - Making changes and pushing them to GitHub

## Fixing the typo

- The function in the `add.R` file contained an obvious typo

- First, let's fix the typo in `add.R`

- Now if we run status it should show that one file has been modified 
- Then, take a snapshot (i.e., `git add/commit`) and push the changes to GitHub (i.e., `git push`)!

```{sh, eval=F, echo=T}
git add --all
git commit -m "fix typo"
git push origin master
```

- Finally, refresh your browswer and see if it worked!

```{r, out.width = "700px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/new-repo-5.png")
```

- **Tip\:** It's good practice to do this every time you make a key change (e.g., fix a typo, add a new function to an R script, etc.).

- Make sure you're in the right directory!

# Putting it all together

- The steps below will walk through an example workflow to show you how to collaborate with others using Git/Github

- The idea behind this is that I will have each of you add your prediction for the upcoming NCAA Football National Championship game between the `r params$team1` and the `r params$team2` on `r params$gameday`.

- On our next class after the game we'll compare the accuracy of everyone's predictions

- If you're not a fan of football, don't worry. The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate how we can distribute files and collect everyone's inputs using Git/Github

- To do this follow these steps:

    1. Fork the course repository into your account
    
    2. Clone your copy of the course repository to your local machine
    
    3. Create a new branch called `cfb_score_lastname` (substitute your last name)
    
    4. Open this new branch
    
    5. Open the file `score_prediction.Rmd` in the `inst/lectures` directory
    
    6. Add your score prediction in the appropriate row
    
    7. Save your changes
    
    8. Commit your changes
    
    9. Push your changes up to your copy of the course repo on Github
    
    10. Create a pull request from your branch in your copy of the course repo to the master branch of the master copy of the course repo 

# All done!
