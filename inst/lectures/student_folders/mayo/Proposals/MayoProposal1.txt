# Package:      FRame.BuildR
#
# Title:        Analytic package providing the tools to construct
#               Frame matrices from various methods. Also provides
#               functions for generating and checking difference
#               sets/families for simple integer-based groups.
#
# Description:  This package is designed for individuals
#               interested in the construction of Frame matrices
#               either in pursuit of new Frame construction methods,
#               determining if an object is a Frame, or quick Frame
#               generation in applications.  The user should understand
#               basic Frame Theory and definitions as well as simple
#               Character Theory of Groups. An understanding of
#               experimental design will also help with the Steiner
#               construction functions. A sample data set (sETF) is
#               provided for the user's ease of understanding. It is not
#               designed as an instruction tool, but rather a suite of
#               tools to aid in the pursuit of Frame Theory applications.
#                 FRame.BuildR provides the user with a variety of
#               functions for constructing and checking Frame
#               Matrices.  The user can either construct a frame
#               using known methods (Steiner, McFarland, Difference
#               sets/families) or construct their own and check its
#               features (e.g. Equiangular, Tight, Equichordal, etc).
#               The focus of the package is to create Frame,
#               Difference Set/Family, or Group objects in order
#               to test new frame construction or the generation
#               of a frame for a given vector space.  In order to
#               provide
#
# Access:       Once the package is installed, the user can call the
#               Frame functions from the command line or script in
#               order to test and build their Frame Matrices.
#
# Security:     FRame.BuildR may require storage of known Frames and
#               example difference sets in order provided to help the
#               user to understand the mechanics of the package.
#
# Appearance:   FRame.BuildR is designed to work inside of the user's
#               chosen R application as a set of function calls and
#               should not interfere with that applications appearance/
#               purpose.
